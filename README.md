I want to try and implement all the following graph algorithms:

Breadth First Search (BFS): Time Complexity - O(|V| + |E|)
Depth First Search (DFS): Time Complexity - O(|V| + |E|)
Topological Sort: Time Complexity - O(|V| + |E|)
Unweighted, Undirected Graph Shortest Path: Time Complexity - O(|V| + |E|)
Dijkstra's Algorithm: Time Complexity - O(|V| + |E|log|V|) {Implemented using a min priority queue}
Prim's Algorithm (MST): Time Complexity - O((|V| + |E|)log|V|).
